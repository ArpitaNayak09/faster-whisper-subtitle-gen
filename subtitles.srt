1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I left food money in the cabinet above the oven,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,880
but that's all you're gonna get so you better make it last.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,920
Hey there, Robert.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,200
I'd offer to help you with your bags, but you're a coon.

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,240
What's he doing here?

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,000
He's your babysitter.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,920
Come on, Grandad.

8
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,720
Me and Riley don't need no babysitter.

9
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,000
We can take care of ourselves.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,200
Yes, not like we're gonna try to kill each other.

11
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,960
Shut up.

12
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,200
Do what Ruckus says and don't mess up my house.

13
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Come on.

14
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,520
Me and this punk fool right here.

15
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,680
OK, first of all, ain't nobody talking while I'm talking,

16
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,280
so shut the fuck up.

17
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,760
My name is Uncle Ruckus, and I will be

18
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,760
a nigger sitting you two until your grandfather retains.

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,480
Your granddad picked me because I am a licensed zoologist.

20
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,280
I have studied a variety of wild animals,

21
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,160
and the African male is by far the most savage laconic.

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
This is an opportunity to observe you

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,320
niggers in your natural habitat and collect data.

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,880
But be warned, whatever nigger chicory

25
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,000
you got up your sleeves does not affect me.
